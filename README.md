## Overview
The Voice-Recognition application, or Ozy, uses vanilla Javascript to respond to what the user says.
## How It Works
Click the link above and allow the application to access your microphone. When you are ready, press the "talk" button and ask your question. When you are done asking your question, the application will decipher what you said and respond accordingly. After the application responds, press the talk button again to ask another question. Below is a list of questions you can ask that will be expanded upon over time as the app becomes more advanced. 

Key words to use
"How are you?" ----- This will elicit one of nine responses
"Weather"----- This will elicit one of five responses
"Yourself" ---- Ozy will tell you about himself


## Technologies Used
HTML5, Javascript
## Role
This is a solo project
## Project Goals
I intend on building out this application to become very complex over time. I will start by expanding the list of questions that can be asked. Next, I would like some questions to cue the application to pull data and return it to the user. For example, I want the user to ask what the weather is in a specific location and have the application return that information verbally and present it on screen. Stay Tuned.
